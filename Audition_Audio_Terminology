/// Men can hear frequencies between 20Hz and 20KHz.
/// amplitude is expressed by DB - desi bels.
/// when we record sound digitaly, we can't record every single moment.
the sample rate represented by Hz, and tells us.
/// if we want to record higher frequencies, we need higher sample rates.
/// your sample rate should be above 2 times higher than the biggest frequency you wanna record. 
sample rate is actually our snapshots of voice.
and this is why we often use 44KHz as lower sample rate, (because the highest frequency we can normally hear is 20KHz.)
some audio engineers set 96000Hz sample rate for incredibly high quality. (and it makes our file larger!)
/// more bit depth allows us to record more amplitude in our sounds. (and also makes larger file.)
/// it's recommended to set bit depth highest bit depth. we can low it if we want, but we keep 
high bit depth sound as our master work.
