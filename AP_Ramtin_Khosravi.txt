Speed and flexibility are two inconsistent things. ( not everywhere! they can work together sometimes.)

--> using namespace std;
--> return 0 has meaning.. it's related to command line arguments. i guess 0 means that program runs correctly and without any
problem, and 2 means error. 1 --> warning.
--> int main(...) is function signature.
--> in unix based systems (mac?) compiler creates a.out output file. if we want to save it with other name, we can use -o .
--> cout means console output.
--> cin is like river stream.
--> cin acts like scanf. if we type ramtin khosravi, it says hello ramtin and ignores khosravi.
--> white space: space, tab, end of line.
--> cin >> name >> age
--> endl equals "\n"
--> if you didn't write return 0, it returns 0 by default.
