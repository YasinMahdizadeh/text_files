We can add or remove panels, by window menu.

in new panel, typing new values is not neccasuary. we can drag text beside the field to change value.
*** lab color: it only uses in photoshop.
*** RGB 8bit means it have 2^8 colors in tonalite, from up to bottom or from right to left.
*** bitmap has 1 bit.
*** we can set background content.
*** uper panel shows each tool settings.
--- V --> Move tool
*** changing pattern scales give us different patterns with different sizes.
*** Fill and Stroke

--- Ctrl + --> zoom in

--- holding alt while holding snaps and changing picture size, makes changes from middle of the element.

________

--- while activing move tool, by ticking auto-select, when we click on an element it selects it's layer.
    this feature can be set for chosing layer or chosing group. (beside the auto-select option.)
    holding crtl while clicking on an object, works like when auto-select is been actived.
_________

--- photoshop is one of the best softwares that have non-destructive option.
--- non-destructive and working with order - it's two great photoshop features.

*** Draging a layer into new layer, makes a copy from it.

*** Rasterizing a layer.
*** non-rasterized layers known by a little icon on right-bottom of the layer.
    make a backup before rasterizing!!
*** one of these icons mean that photoshop knows layer from its origin.
    what's it's benefit?
    after resizing, it's quality doesn't change. but if we rasterize the photo, after descending and decreasing 
    it's size, it's quality will Be a lot lower :(

--- Ctrl z in photoshop only remembers one last action.
--- Ctrl + Alt + z : undos more than one action.
--- Ctrl + Shift + z : redos more than one action.

*** Polygon, we can select unformal shapes by using this.
--- Double click while using polygon, closes it.

*** Lesso tool: Free hand selecting
*** in the select menu, we have color range and we can select by giving a color to it.
*** color range selecting don't work 0 and 1. it selects some pixels more, and some less (?)
*** select --> focus area
--- ctrl + T : Free transform
*** edit -- prespective warp
--- crtl + shift+ T : redos Free Transform action

QQQ Ctrl + Shift + T and layers.
